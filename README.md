A handwritten digit recognition project built with Python and TensorFlow/Keras. This neural network classifies digits from the MNIST dataset with high accuracy 
and the reason I built this  because it is  a beginner-friendly introduction to AI/ML.

Features:

1-Simple, readable neural network for digit classification
2-Normalizes and preprocesses MNIST dataset
3-Evaluates model accuracy on test data
5-Visualizes predictions for sample digits

Tech Stack:

1-Python 3.x
2-TensorFlow / Keras
3-NumPy
4-Matplotlib
